# Daily Log â€“ 2025-05-29

- Summary: Continued work on integrating `.mdx` lesson pages with dynamic routing and Obsidian compatibility. The previous dayâ€™s errors were resolved. Began implementation of the word-wrapping + clickable vocab system (`AutoWrap`) to enable AI-assisted lookups. Also explored the idea of linking clicked words to a dictionary backend where users can fetch translations, definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and eventually build flashcards or stories with AI.

- Issues:
  - None critical today â€” previous runtime and module errors were resolved overnight.
  - Design challenge: how to structure the clicked word â†’ API â†’ vocab tagging â†’ AI flow in a way thatâ€™s scalable.

- Commands:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- Wins:
  - ðŸ§  Implemented functional AutoWrap system that wraps and colorizes each word in lesson paragraphs
  - âœ… Click handler works and prepares query to send to backend for word lookup
  - âœ¨ Drafted AI-driven vocab engine idea that includes DeepL + GPT integration
  - ðŸŽ¯ Markdown lessons now render cleanly with working layout and clickable words
