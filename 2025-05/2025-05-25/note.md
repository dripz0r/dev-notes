# Daily Log – 2025-05-25

- Summary: Successfully booted up the first version of the `german-lernreise` project using `npm run dev` and confirmed local server was working. This marked the real beginning of my learning journal and dev focus.

- Issues: None at this stage — initial template loaded as expected.

- Commands:
  ```bash
  npx create-next-app german-lernreise
  cd german-lernreise
  npm run dev

- Wins: ✅ First local dev server live, and folder structure was set. Got the Next.js default page running.
